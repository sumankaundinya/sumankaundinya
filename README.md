# 👋 Hi there, I am Suman 👋

I am a full-stack web developer in the making, passionate about building dynamic, user-focused applications. I’m nearing completion of my training at Hack Your Future, where I’ve gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, and Git.

Currently, I’m working with React.js and Next.js to build modern, full-stack web apps with dynamic routing, API integration, and responsive UI using Material UI. My latest project, a Meal Sharing app, brings together everything I’ve learned — from backend APIs to frontend deployment on Render.

### 🌱 My Learning Path
🎓 Hack Your Future (nearly completed!)
Full-stack web development bootcamp covering everything from the basics to production-ready apps.

📜 HTML & CSS
Mastered semantic structure and responsive design with CSS Modules.

🖥️ JavaScript
Proficient in ES6+, asynchronous code (Promises, async/await), and DOM manipulation.

🔧 Git & GitHub
Comfortable with branching, merging, resolving conflicts, stashing, cherry-picking, and resetting commits.

💻 Node.js
Built RESTful APIs and learned how to connect backend services to databases.

🗄️ MySQL
Designed and queried relational databases; deployed on Clever Cloud.

⚛️ React.js
Developing reusable components, managing state with hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext, useReducer).

⚡ Next.js
Building full-stack apps with the App Router, SSR, SSG, dynamic routes, and API routes.

✍️ UI & UX
Using Material UI and CSS Modules for styling; focused on accessibility and user experience.

📽️ Presenting Projects
